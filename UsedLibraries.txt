            paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297)

MoCo
MoCo (Momentum Contrast) is a deep learning approach for unsupervised visual
representation learning. It uses a contrastive loss framework to learn meaningful features
from unlabeled images, making it useful in situations where labeled data is limited.
MoCo is notable for its innovative use of a momentum-based moving average
of the model parameters, facilitating stable and effective learning of visual representations.
